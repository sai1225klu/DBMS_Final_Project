1. Retrieve Locations of specific features 
2. Calculate Distance between points 
3. Calculate Areas of Interest (specific to each group) 
4. Analyze the queries 
5. Sorting and Limit Executions 
6. Optimize the queries to speed up execution time 
7. N-Optimization of queries 
8. Presentation and Posting to Individual GitHub 
9. Code functionality, documentation and proper output provided
